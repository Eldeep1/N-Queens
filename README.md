# n-queens

##### you can read comments from line 107 on the main.py , it have the same thing that is shown here :)
 when you want to add a queen you can call showing_queen function
 
     if you are implementing genetic , so call it like that : showing_queen(fourth_chessboard_frame,x,y)
     
     while x and y stands for the position of the queen you want to show on the matrix
     
     if you want to delete the queen you entered , you can call remove_queen function
     
     if you are implementing backtracking , so call it like that : remove_queen(chessboard_frame,x,y)
  ###   got the difference yet ?
  
     the first element you should pass while implementing the algorithms is :
     back tracking:chessboard_frame
     hill climbing:second_chessboard_frame
     best first searh:third_chessboard_frame
     genetic:fourth_chessboard_frame
